        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Advait Risbud and I am a final year computer science student at Carleton Univerisity.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my computer science education at Carleton University, I developed multiple desktop and CLI applications both as academic work, and personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have developed a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming in Python, C++, and Java. I am capable of using relational databases in SQL that model real world systems. I have collaborated in a team of four to develop a library management system in C++, that featured a GUI made with the Qt library, allowing patrons to borrow and place holds on items, while librarians could manage the catalogue data. I also developed a Java-based CLI fitness club management system that backed by an SQL database connected with JDBC, where I implemented CRUD functionality allowing users to sign up for accounts, when they signed in they could book classes and view their health metrics. I am capable of using git and GitHub to track my development process and explain each step of my development process. 
        </p>
